1. The climate_starter.ipynb is the jupyter notebook to

c. Station analysis.

2. The app.py is the python file showing the climate app design portion of the challenge. It captures:-
a. The API SQLite Connection & Landing Page

I was unable to debug my API dynamic route where I attempted to code the start and the end route. Have a tutor session on the weekend to understand the problem.
